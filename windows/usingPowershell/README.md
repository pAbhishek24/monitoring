This script is the base version, designed to capture the metrices like cpu. memory, network, disk related information. These metrices can be used to monitor system behaviour under diferent condition. For capturing system related information, using Perfmon API. Different text file contains counter name which collects data at specific interval and stores into a csv file. Here a specific folder structure is maintained just for clarility like where scripts are, where counter files will be placed and where logs or say counter information will be placed.<br>Folder structure: <ul><li>WORKSPACE - main direcotry, under WORKSPACE we have 3 other directory "scripts" (containing powershell script for monitoring or other post activities as well)</li><li>"logs" (this direcotry contains all the csv file collected after running the powershell script)</li><li>"data" (this directory contains the counter txt file - all monitoring counters)</li></ul>Counter files and informations:<ul><li>cacheInfo.txt - This file contains counters related to cache information</li><li>diskUtilization.txt - this file containd counters related to disk utillizations</li><li>memoryInfo.txt - this file contains counters related to memory utilization</li><li>networkInfo.txt - all network related counters are placed in this files</li><li>processInfo.txt - all process related information are placed in this files</li><li>processorInfo.txt - processor related counter to capture stats are placed in this file</li><li>threadInfo.txt - all thread related counters information are placed in this file</li></ul>NOTE : we need to place all these text file inside directory named "data"<br><b><u>For running this powershell script :</u></b><br>STEP 1 : Navigate to the required "script" folder where the script are placedcd D:\WORKSPACE\scripts<br>STEP 2 :Variable which are passed as argument to the command line are :<ul><li>-cT : This variable holdes the infomation that how many time you need to run the script</li><li>-wT : this variable holds the information of wait provided between each iteration of the script execution</li><li>-bID: this variable holds a generaic number provided by user during run time which created directory within the "logs" folder in your workspace under current date directory to segregate the reports</li><li>-procName : variable holds the name of the process which we need to monitor</li><li>-wspc : this folder holds the name of your workspace in which your "data", "logs" and "script" folder are present</li></ul> IN command prompt execute :<br/>
                  D:\WORKSPACE\script\PS_win-Monitor.ps1 -cT 10 -wT 2 -bID 5 -procName chrome -wspc D:\WORKSPACE<br>
<b>NOTE : You will get all the logs in the "logs" folder inside the your WORKSPACE</b>
